# Project-Etch-A-Sketch

Project Etch A Sketch was made with the use of HTML, an external CSS and an external JavaScript.

This project expanded my knowledge of manipulating DOM and implementing properties of JavaScript such as: addEventListeners, forEach and querySelector.

Working through this project required a lot of grit and diligence as there was many different ways that I had started off with before narrowing down on a tactic and formulation that made sense to me and resulted in the correct visual display.
